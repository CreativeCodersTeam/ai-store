description: Writes and improves JUnit 5 unit tests for Java projects. Use when asked to create unit tests, write parameterized/data-driven tests, improve test coverage, set up mocking with Mockito, or follow testing best practices with JUnit Jupiter. Covers test structure, assertions, @ParameterizedTest, @ValueSource, @CsvSource, and @MethodSource.

# JUnit 5+ Best Practices

## Project Setup

- Use a standard Maven or Gradle project structure.
- Place test source code in `src/test/java`.
- Include dependencies for `junit-jupiter-api`, `junit-jupiter-engine`, and `junit-jupiter-params` for parameterized tests.
- Use build tool commands to run tests: `mvn test` or `gradle test`.

## Test Structure

- Test classes should have a `Test` suffix, e.g., `CalculatorTest` for a `Calculator` class.
- Use `@Test` for test methods.
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern.
- Name tests using a descriptive convention, like `methodName_should_expectedBehavior_when_scenario`.
- Use `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` for per-test setup and teardown.
- Use `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` for per-class setup and teardown (must be static methods).
- Use `@DisplayName` to provide a human-readable name for test classes and methods.

## Standard Tests

- Test one logical condition per method, keeping each test focused on a single behavior.
- Make tests independent and idempotent: no shared mutable state, no ordering assumptions, runnable in any order.

## Data-Driven (Parameterized) Tests

- Use `@ParameterizedTest` to mark a method as a parameterized test.
- Use `@ValueSource` for simple literal values (strings, ints, etc.).
- Use `@MethodSource` to refer to a factory method that provides test arguments as a `Stream`, `Collection`, etc.
- Use `@CsvSource` for inline comma-separated values.
- Use `@CsvFileSource` to use a CSV file from the classpath.
- Use `@EnumSource` to use enum constants.

## Assertions

- Use `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` or AssertJ for more fluent assertions.
- Use `assertThrows` / `assertDoesNotThrow` for exception testing.
- Group related assertions with `assertAll`.

## Mocking and Isolation

- Use a mocking framework like Mockito to create mock objects for dependencies.
- Use `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks` annotations from Mockito to simplify mock creation and injection.
- Use interfaces to facilitate mocking.

## Test Organization

- Group tests by feature or component using packages.
- Use `@Tag` to categorize tests (e.g., `@Tag("fast")`, `@Tag("integration")`).
- Use `@TestMethodOrder(MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation.class)` and `@Order` to control test execution order when strictly necessary.
- Use `@Disabled` to temporarily skip a test method or class, providing a reason.
- Use `@Nested` to group tests in a nested inner class for better organization and structure.
